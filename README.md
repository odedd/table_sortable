# TableSortable

TableSortable will help you leverage the power of the pager widget or plugin 
for the excellent tablesorter jQuery plugin, and handle all the backend filtering, paging and sorting for you.

NOTICE: This gem is in INCREDIBLY early stages of development.
It is still**not documented**nor is it**properly tested**, 
so I strongly discourage you from using it for anything 
other than playing around at this point.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'table_sortable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install table_sortable

## Usage

Coming soon...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
