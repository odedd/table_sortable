# TableSortable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/odedd/table_sortable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/odedd/table_sortable)

TableSortable adds multi-column, **server-side** filtering, sorting and pagination 
to the **tableSorter jQuery plugin**, so you don't have to worry about interpreting the query parameters,
customizing queries, fields to sort by, or how to send the correct page to the client.

It is a Rails backend complementation to the frontend tableSorter.js.


#### The Problem
The jQuery tableSorter plugin is an excellent tool for filtering and sorting tables. 
When dealing with lots of rows, we usually want to split the table into multiple pages. tableSorter has a nifty [widget](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-pager-ajax.html) for that, which requires using [mottie's fork](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/index.html) of tableSorter.

Usually this is a scenario where we don't want to send our entire set of records to the frontend,
which consequently means that the frontend no longer knows the entire set of records to filter and sort through.
This requires our *server* to handle all that stuff, as well as the pagination of the results.

#### The Solution: TableSortable
TableSortable will handle all the backend filtering, sorting and pagination for you.

NOTICE: This gem is in very early stages of development, and is not yet fully documented.  Any input will be more than welcome.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'table_sortable'
```

Then run `bundle install` and you're ready to start

You should also probably be using jquery-tablesorter.  
For information regarding integration or tableSorter into your Rails project, 
please see the [jQuery tablesorter plugin for Rails](https://github.com/themilkman/jquery-tablesorter-rails) page.

## Usage

First, we need to setup our controller.  
Let's say we have our users controller. Let's include TableSortable so that we can use its methods.

```ruby
#controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  include TableSortable
```

Next, let's define our columns.
```ruby
#controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  include TableSortable
  
  define_colunns :first_name, :last_name, :email, :created_at
```
That's the basic setup of columns. For more configuration options, please see [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).

Now we need to make sure our `index` action filters, sorts and paginates the records.  
We can do that using the `filter_and_sort` method.
```ruby
#controllers/users_controller.rb
def index
  
  @users = filter_and_sort(User.all)
  
  respond_to do |format|
        format.html {}
        format.json {render layout: false}
  end
end
```

In our view we can use TableSortable's [view helpers](#view-helpers) to render our table.
```erb
#views/users/index.html.erb
<div id="usersPager"><%= table_sortable_pager %></div>
<table id="usersTable" data-query="<%= users_path %>">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <%= table_sortable_headers %>
        </tr>
    </thead>
</table>
```

Let's say we have a tableSorter table which poll's the database for data. Here's a simple configuration example for that:

```javascript
var table = $('#usersTable');
table.tablesorter({
    widgets: ['filter', 'pager'],
    widgetOptions: {
        // show 10 records at a time
        pager_size: 10,
        // Poll our users_index_path.
        // A better practice would be to use the table's 
        // data-query attribute instead, but more on that later)
        pager_ajaxUrl: table.data('query') + '?pagesize={size}&page={page}&{filterList:fcol}&{sortList:scol}',
        // Parse the incoming result
        pager_ajaxProcessing: function (data) {
            if (data && data.hasOwnProperty('rows')) {
                // Update the pager output
                this.pager_output = data.pager_output;
                // return total records, the rows HTML data,
                // and the headers information.
                return [data.total, $(data.rows), data.headers];
            }
        }
    }
});
```
For full documentation regarding the usage of tableSorter please go [here](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/index.html) for the very popular fork by mottie, or [here](http://tablesorter.com/docs/) for the original version of the plugin.

Now, the results fetched from the server would be filtered, sorter and paginated by TableSortable.

Of course there are many more configuration options that make TableSortable flexible and adaptable. For those, please see [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration)
